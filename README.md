# FromBitToQubit

**FromBitToQubit** is an interactive and gamified educational platform designed to guide students from **classical computing** concepts to the **fundamentals of quantum computing**.  
The project uses a **Learning Path** approach, where each module combines short theory, interactive simulations, and mini-challenges to reinforce understanding.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Provide an accessible and engaging way to learn quantum computing by building upon familiar classical concepts, making the transition from bits to qubits intuitive and motivating.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Gamified Learning Path** with 8 progressive modules.
- Integration with **Q#** for local quantum simulation.
- **WPF** application with a clean, dark-themed UI.
- Theory â†’ Simulation â†’ Challenge cycle in each module.
- Offline operation without internet dependency.

## ðŸ“š Learning Path
1. Classical Bits & Boolean Logic
2. Basics of Classical Physics
3. Bits vs Qubits
4. Quantum Logic Gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, CNOT)
5. Superposition
6. Quantum Entanglement
7. Classical vs Quantum Problem Solving
8. Final Challenge

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **C# / WPF** for UI
- **Q#** (Microsoft Quantum Development Kit) for simulations
- MVVM architecture for modularity
- Future-ready design for Qiskit integration

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
- Windows executable (`.exe`)
- Documentation with theory, screenshots, and learning path
- Demo video showcasing all modules
